- LinkedIn scraping lives in `src/lib/linkedin/scraper.server.ts` (a port of Shreyaan/linkedin-profile-api), exposed via `src/lib/linkedin.functions.ts`; the cookie header is sent per request from tab sessionStorage and never stored server-side or logged — keeps the app stateless and the secret off disk.
- Optional scraping-API relay (key auto-detected in `src/lib/linkedin/providers.ts`) is tried first per scrape and falls back stickily to direct session fetch on provider failure; key/proxy live in tab sessionStorage like the cookie — keeps secrets off the server.
